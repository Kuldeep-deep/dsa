        <h2>1. Arrays</h2>
        <p>An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It provides a simple way to store and access data. Operations like insertion and deletion can be less efficient compared to other data structures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Linked Lists</h2>
        <p>A linked list is a linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion but may require more memory compared to arrays.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Stacks</h2>
        <p>A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. Common operations include push (add) and pop (remove).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Queues</h2>
        <p>A queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Common operations include enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Trees</h2>
        <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and branching nodes. Each node has child nodes, and the structure is often used to represent hierarchical relationships.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Graphs</h2>
        <p>A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected and have various applications, such as modeling relationships between entities.</p>
